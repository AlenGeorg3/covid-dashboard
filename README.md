### Overview:
This project presents a thorough analysis of COVID-19 data using Tableau, offering insights into the pandemic's dynamics and informing decision-making processes for various stakeholders. By leveraging diverse datasets and visualizations, the project aims to contribute to the global effort in combating the pandemic.

### Dashboards:
1. **Overview Dashboard:** Provides a snapshot of average daily cases and deaths, total deaths, and total cases, facilitating rapid response planning and resource allocation.
   
2. **Timeline Dashboard:** Displays an annotated timeline of cases and deaths, correlating significant events with pandemic trends to guide public health measures and communication strategies.
   
3. **Region-wise Effect Dashboard:** Features geographic plots and ranking tables to highlight regions needing more resources or stricter containment measures.
   
4. **Variant Analysis Dashboard:** Focuses on the emergence and spread of COVID-19 variants, aiding in understanding variant virulence and guiding public health responses.
   
5. **Regional Distribution of Variants Dashboard:** Presents variant distribution and detection rates across regions, facilitating targeted testing and vaccination efforts.
   
6. **Hospitalization Over Time Dashboard:** Tracks hospitalization and ICU admissions over time, offering insights into healthcare system strain and guiding resource allocation.
   
7. **Hospitalization Over Variants Dashboard:** Correlates hospitalization data with variant spread over time, aiding in healthcare preparedness and public health measures.
   
8. **Hospitalization Across Regions Dashboard:** Provides a comparative view of ICU versus general hospitalizations across regions, facilitating regional planning and emergency resource allocation.
   
9. **Variants Across Casualties and Cases Dashboard:** Analyzes the relationship between variants and case/casualty numbers over time, directing scientific research and public health measures.
   
10. **Vaccination Effect on Cases and Deaths Dashboard:** Visualizes vaccination progress alongside trends in cases and deaths, demonstrating the effectiveness of vaccination campaigns and guiding future strategies.

### Engineered Features Analysis:
- **Relationship: Vaccination Coverage Rate and Case Fatality Rate:** Analyzes the impact of vaccination coverage on COVID-19 severity and fatality, guiding vaccination strategies.
   
- **Relationship: Cases per Capita and Deaths per Capita:** Identifies regions needing stronger healthcare interventions based on high cases and deaths per capita.
   
- **Relationship: Hospitalization Rate and Case Fatality Rate:** Explores the correlation between hospitalization rates and fatality, informing healthcare response planning.
   
- **Relationship: Recovery Rate and Vaccination Rate:** Examines the influence of vaccination on COVID-19 recovery rates to optimize post-COVID care strategies.
